# 279#6 Distance Traveled
# The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
# Distance = Speed Ã— Time
# Design a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle
# (in miles per hour)
# and how many hours it has traveled.
# It should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle
# has traveled for each hour of that time period.
# Here is an example of the output:
# What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 70 [Enter]
# How many hours has it traveled? 3 [Enter]
# Hour      Distance Traveled
# ----------------------------
# 1         70
# 2         140
# 3         210
