# 540 #7 Best Golf Score
# (You will need to develop that flowchart and python program)
# Read from keyboard golfer names and scores
# and write them to golf.dat
# Read names and scores from golf.dat and display them

# Find the lowest score
# and display the playerâ€™s name and the score.

# Title:        Best Golf Score
# Inputs:       Golfer Names and Scores
# Process:      (1) Write to golf.dat input from keyboard
#               (2) Read names and scores from golf.dat
#               (3) Find the lowest score
#
# Outputs:      (1) Display names and scores from golf.dat
#               (2) Display the lowest score and the player/s who owns that score
