# 540 #4 Avg of Numbers
# Create a file (using notepad)
# containing a series of 15 integers
# named numbers.dat in the same folder as your program.
# Develop a program that
# reads the numbers
# and calculates
# the average of all the numbers stored in the file.
# Display the numbers and the average.
# (You donâ€™t need to submit the numbers.dat file
# with your assignment. I have one to use to test/grade with.)
